# A Homebrew tap for Hyperion.NG
Install [`Hyperion.NG`](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) on macOS via Homebrew

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> First, make sure you have installed [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh) if you haven't yet.

## Installation

Add hyperion to local homebrew cask. You only need to do this once.
```
brew tap hyperion-project/hyperion.ng
```

Install hyperion
```
brew install --cask --no-quarantine hyperion
```

> [!TIP] Why you need the "--no-quarantine" parameter?
> MacOS marks all files downloaded from the Internet as quarantined. When you run a quarantined program, macOS displays the message **Hyperion canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"**.
> Of course, the new program is downloaded from the Internet, so don't mark it as quarantined use the **"--no-quarantine"** option*.

## Uninstall

Run the following:
```
brew uninstall --cask hyperion
brew untap hyperion-project/hyperion.ng
```
